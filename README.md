# Contour
The tool for finding shortcuts over difficult terrain.
Badge approvals & notifications:
This tool allows members to easily request badges they've earnt but haven't yet recieved without confronting email. Simply enter your name, badge and level and a pre-made email will be sent off to your leader for review. This tool will also update logs in a google sheet to easily see which scouts are still waiting for their badge.

Group badge summaries:
Want to see all the badges someone has earned without having to click through 10 different pages? Scrap that. Want to see every badge that everyone has completed on one, printable report? Your wish is my command.
Head over to the "Group Life" page. Select your unit, then hit the "Generate Report" button below the table.
